The Multi Select Component is inspired by [campsite.design](https://campsite.design/)'s and [cal.com](https://cal.com)'s settings forms. It is:

- simple and lightweight
- keyboard accessible including `backspace` to remove label
- powered by the headless command menu package [`cmdk`](https://cmdk.paco.me), made by [@paco](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey) and [@raunofreiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg)
- designed with [ui.shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)

If you don't want to install [`cmdk`](https://cmdk.paco.me) and create and maintain your own component, I recommend you to check out [`react-select`](https://react-select.com/) instead.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mxkaske/mxkaske.dev/tree/main/components/craft/fancy-multi-select.tsx).
