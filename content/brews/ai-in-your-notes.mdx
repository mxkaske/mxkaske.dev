Having AI in your notes is a **curse** and a **blessing**.

- The **blessing**: it helps you to write notes _a lot faster_.
- The **curse**: it helps you to write notes _a lot faster_.

At this point in time, I spend more time reading what AI writes than thinking for myself. Especially when I just want to think about stuff, AI suggestions take too much visual space and I hate it.
