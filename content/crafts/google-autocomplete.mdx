It requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza..."` in your environment variables to run.

A _server action_ is used to fetch the data from Google Places API. If you are not using Next.js, make sure to query the data on the server.

Design inspired by [Stripe Checkout](https://checkout.stripe.dev).

Speedrun to get a `GOOGLE_API_KEY`:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
4. Create Credentials > API key
5. Set Application restrictions to "Websites" and API restrictions to at least having "Places API" enabled
6. Go to Google Maps Platform > APIs & Services
7. Enable the Places API
